# pearOS-arch-base ðŸ“Œ
It is pearOS, but with Arch Base. Yes! It uses vanilla arch, less bugs, easier, better etc.

## Why? ðŸ“Œ
I had enough with debian-based distros.
pearOS with arch base, solve some of the big problems with pearOS, for example:

> "it uses a different distribution for the base with almost every release"

> "this require you to reinstall with every new release"

> "sudo apt upgrade would/will destroy your installation"

> "if they really don't have the money, they just shouldn't have used the third party host"

> "They use the macos icons and are making money off of it"

Not anymore. With arch, there no more base-hopping
Now, with arch, the system is now Rolling Release, as it should be :>

( fixed in the latest debian builds but eh")
You can do now `sudo pacman -Syu` and you will stil have the pearOS branding.
With the new Arch base, the system is 2GB in size!! Good enough to save storage space on what I call the pearOS CDN.
I heard that too! I do not make money from macOS icons but I changed them in NiceC0re anyways!!

## Ok... How do I build it? ðŸ“Œ
Make sure you satisfy the deps in the section below.
After that, run `./build-binary` and ~~pray~~ wait.


### Deps: ðŸ“Œ
```sh
sudo pacman -S mtools
sudo pacman -S squashfs-tools
sudo pacman -S pkgfile
sudo pacman -S xorriso
sudo pkgfile --update
pkgfile pacstrap
sudo pacman -S extra/arch-install-scripts
```
